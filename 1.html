Meanwhile, bear my soul heavy with yearning's dull pain,<br>
To those soft woodland hillocks, those meadows, green, gleaming,<br>
Spread wide along each side of the blue-flowing Niemen,<br>
To those fields, which by various grain painted, there lie<br>
Shimmering, with wheat gilded, and silvered with rye;<br>
Where grows the amber mustard, buckwheat white as snow,<br>
Where, with maidenly blushes, clover flowers glow,<br>
And all as if beribboned by green strips of land,<br>
The balks, upon which scattered quiet pear trees stand.<br>
