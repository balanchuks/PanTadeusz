All, of victory certain, cry out with tears thus:<br/>
"God is with Napoleon, Napoleon's with us!"<br/>
O Spring! Who had then witnessed you walk through our fields,<br/>
Spring of war unforgotten, spring of bounteous yields!<br/>
O Spring, who'd seen you blossom abundantly then<br/>
With corn and with green grasses, and glittering with men,<br/>
Profuse with events, pregnant with hope unfulfilled!<br/>
O fair phantom of dreamland, I can see you still!<br/>
I, in slavery born, and then swaddled with chain,<br/>
Only one such spring knew, and will not know again.<br/>
