When talk was to raise Poland again from this rubble,<br/>
And of common good, stupid, all you did was squabble,<br/>
No one could, stupid, either exchange proper views,<br/>
In some good order, stupid, nor properly choose<br/>
A chief over you, stupid! But should one by chance<br/>
Bring out your private hurts, fools, agreement at once!<br/>
